        <p>
          Born in 1996, I grew up during the digital rise. As a teenager, I
          started building my first websites and got more and more interested in
          the digital economy.

        <p>
          After school, I started to study{' '}
          <span className='highlight'>
            Computer Science as a bachelor&apos;s degree
          </span>{' '}
          at Singidunum University and completed many online courses alongside.

          Passionate and self-motivated junior{' '}
          <span className='highlight'>full-stack software developer</span> eager
          to turn ideas into applications. My ambitions are to stay on the
          leading edge of the <span className='highlight'>web development</span>{' '}
          industry and find new learning opportunities or projects to keep

          I work to create modern, responsive websites and applications that
          suit the wants and needs of my clients while solving problems through
          innovative solutions and collaboration.

          Out of the office, you will find me traveling, dreaming of basketball,
          playing video games, and petting all the good cats in the world. ðŸ˜¸
